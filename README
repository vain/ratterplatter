Don't you miss the feeling of a "real" computer? Isn't a modern PC with
SSDs and without fans way too quiet? You should use ratterplatter!

This program emulates the noise of my Pentium 133 from the 1990ies, with
focus on the hard disk. It uses actual recordings from that computer.


Installation
------------

The following C libraries are required:

    - libao

ratterplatter expects to be run on Linux and needs /proc/diskstats.

To build the program and install it to /usr/local:

    $ make SAMPLE_DIR=/usr/local/share/ratterplatter/samples
    # make install

Note the usage of $SAMPLE_DIR. If this variable is unset, the program
will look for samples relative to the current directory in "./samples/"
(which is fine for testing purposes).


Running
-------

Just run the program:

    $ ratterplatter

The program evaluates actual disk I/O, so you might want to drop your
caches every now and then -- because on modern systems with many
gigabytes of RAM, there's not *that* much real disk I/O going on
anymore:

    # echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches


Background
----------

According to my personal records, the machine was most likely bought in
1995 (I'm not 100% sure). It's an Intel Pentium with 133 MHz and 32 MB
RAM, which was later upgraded to 64 MB. At first, it only had a generic
VGA graphics card (which is now lost), and was later upgraded to an ATi
3D Charger to allow for *some* basic 3D games. :-)

The hard drive that you can hear in ratterplatter is a Seagate Medalist
8641 with 8.6 GB. It was probably built in 1999 (according to the "Date
Code"), so it was an upgrade that was added later.

Here are some photos of the machine and the disk, including
"openbsd57-startx.ogg" from which all the samples in ratterplatter were
taken:
