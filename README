Don't you miss the feeling of a "real" computer? Isn't a modern PC with
SSDs and without fans way too quiet? You should use ratterplatter!

This program simulates the noise of my Pentium 133 from 1995, with focus
on the hard disk. It uses actual recordings from that computer.


Installation
------------

The following C libraries are required:

    - libao

ratterplatter expects to be run on Linux and needs /proc/diskstats.

To build the program and install it to /usr/local:

    $ make SAMPLE_DIR=/usr/local/share/ratterplatter/samples
    # make install

Note the usage of $SAMPLE_DIR. If this variable is unset, the program
will look for samples relative to the current directory in "./samples/"
(which is fine for testing purposes).


Running
-------

Just run the program:

    $ ratterplatter
