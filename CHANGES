Release history for ratterplatter

next
  [Changed]
  - Re-recorded all samples in better quality (IMHO) and added more
    samples.
  - Play extra sounds on startup and shutdown.
  - Default SAMPLE_DIR will now be canonicalized using 'readlink -e' to
    avoid having to change directories.
  - Only errors will be printed to STDERR, everything else goes to
    STDOUT. (Previously, all output was sent to STDERR.)

  [Added]
  - A systemd unit file.

v16.11  2016-11-01
  [Added]
